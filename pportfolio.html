        <strong>Quick Cop</strong><br>
        Designer<br>
        Feb 2018 - Jun 2018<br>
        I designed and helped program a part of Quick Cop, an application to acquire rare and limited clothing and shoes. I worked on the Aurora Links team, which spearheaded a massive renovation of the app. We changed some of the layout and gave it a new design. Quick Cop continues to use Aurora's design and changes because of the resounding response it received once changed.

        <strong>Aurora Links</strong><br>
        CEO / Founder<br>
        Feb 2017 - Mar 2019<br>
        Aurora Links was a project that helped sneakerheads and resellers alike find where items were being released before the stores had uploaded them to their websites. We used backend scraping to find the items and then sent them to users. The project ended after it was sold to a company back in 2019.
